# Specification Quality Checklist: Generic Provider Model for Market Data

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-19
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**Validation Status**: âœ… PASSED (2025-10-19)

All checklist items have been validated and passed. The specification has been cleaned of implementation details:
- Removed specific technology references (Lua, REST APIs, WebSocket, specific code line counts)
- Reframed provider examples (Alpha Vantage, Polygon.io) as tier characteristics rather than requirements
- Made success criteria technology-agnostic (e.g., "less than one day of work" instead of "200 lines of code")
- Generalized authentication and integration assumptions to avoid prescribing specific technical approaches

The specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
